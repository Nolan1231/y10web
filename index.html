          Here are some of the benefits of investing:
         <br>
         <br>
          1. If you don’t invest and grow your money, you’ll actually end up losing money over time because of inflation. Inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services.
